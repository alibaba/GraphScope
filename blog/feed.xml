<title>A Review of Programming Models for Parallel Graph Processing</title>
<description><p><img src="/blog/assets/images/programing-models.jpg" alt="programing-models" /> To explore underlying insights hidden in graph data, many graph analytics algorithms, e.g., PageRank and single source shortest paths (the Dijkstra’s algorithm), have been designed to solve different problems.</p> <p>In a single machine environment, developers can easily implement sequential solutions to these algorithms as they have a global view of the graph and can freely iterate through all vertices and edges. Current graph data in real industrial scenarios usually consists of billions of vertices and trillions of edges. Such a graph has to be divided into multiple partitions, and stored and processed in a distributed/parallel way. To allow developers to succinctly express graph algorithms under such environment, many programming models for parallel graph processing have been proposed. In this post, we would like to introduce some commonly used programming models, and further discuss their pros and cons.</p> <h4 id="think-like-a-vertex">Think like a vertex</h4> <p>The vertex-centric model proposed in Pregel[1] follows the philosophy of “think like a vertex”, where each vertex contains information about itself as well as all its adjacent edges, and the computation is expressed at the level of a single vertex. More specifically, the entire computation process is divided into multiple iterations (called <em>supersteps</em>), and in each superstep, all vertices execute the same user-defined function (called <em>vertex program</em>) that expresses the logic of a given algorithm. The vertex program defines how each vertex processes incoming messages (sent in the previous superstep), and sends messages to other vertices (for the next superstep). The iterations terminate until no messages are sent from any vertex, indicating a halt.</p> <p><img src="/blog/assets/images/vertex-messaging.png" alt="vertex-model" /></p> <p>With the vertex-centric model, the vertex program of single source shortest paths (SSSP) is expressed as follows.</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">VertexProgramForSSSP</span><span class="p">():</span> <span class="c1"># receive and merge incoming messages </span> <span class="n">incoming_msgs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ReceiveMessages</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">merged_msg</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Reduce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">incoming_msgs</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">MIN</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># update vertex property </span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">dist</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">merged_msg</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">dist</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">merged_msg</span> <span class="c1"># send messages to neighbors </span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">neighbor</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">neighbors</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">dist</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">edge_weight</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">neighbor_dist</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">SendMessage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">neighbor</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dist</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">edge_weight</span><span class="p">)</span> </code></pre></div></div> <p>However, the performance of Pregel drops dramatically when facing natural graphs which follow a power-law distribution. To solve this problem, PowerGraph[2] proposed the GAS (Gather-Apply-Scatter) programming model for the vertex-cut graph partitioning strategy. The <em>Gather</em> function runs locally on each partition and then one accumulator is sent from each mirror to the master. The master runs the <em>Apply</em> function and then sends the updated vertex data to all mirrors. Finally, the <em>Scatter</em> phase is run in parallel on mirrors to update the data on adjacent edges.</p> <p><img src="/blog/assets/images/gas.png" alt="gas-model" /></p> <p>Following the GAS abstraction, the SSSP can be implemented as follows.</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">GASForSSSP</span><span class="p">():</span> <span class="c1"># gather_nbrs: ALL_NBRS </span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">gather</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">D_u</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">D</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">u</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">D_v</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">D_v</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">D</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">u</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">min</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">apply</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">D_u</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">new_dist</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="n">D_u</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">new_dist</span> <span class="c1"># scatter_nbrs: ALL_NBRS </span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">scatter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">D_u</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">D</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">u</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="n">D_v</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="c1"># If changed, activate neighbor </span> <span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">changed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">D_u</span><span class="p">)):</span> <span class="n">Activate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">increased</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">D_u</span><span class="p">)):</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">NULL</span> <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">D_u</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">D</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">u</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">)</span> </code></pre></div></div> <h5 id="pros">Pros:</h5> <ul> <li>Powerful expressiveness to express various graph algorithms.</li> <li>The vertex program is easy to run parallelly.</li> </ul> <h5 id="cons">Cons:</h5> <ul> <li>Existing sequential (single-machine) graph algorithms have to be modified to comply with the “think like a vertex” principle.</li> <li>Each vertex is very short-sighted: it only has information about its 1-hop neighbors, and thus information is propagated through the graph slowly, one hop at a time. As a result, it may take many computation iterations to propagate a piece of information from a source to a destination.</li> </ul> <h4 id="think-like-a-graph">Think like a graph</h4> <p>To tackle the problem of short-sighted vertices in the vertex-centric model, the subgraph-centric (a.k.a. block-centric, partition-centric) programming model[3, 4] is proposed. Different from the vertex-centric model, the subgraph-centric model focuses on the entire subgraph, and is labeled as “think like a graph”. For the vertex-centric model, it uses the information of 1-hop neighbors to update the value of each vertex in one superstep. Instead, the subgraph-centric model leverages information within the whole subgraph. In addition, each vertex can send messages to any vertex in the graph, instead of 1-hop neighbors. In this way, the communication overhead and the number of supersteps are greatly reduced.</p> <p>The SSSP is expressed as follows in the subgraph-centric model.</p> <div class="language-python

high performance at the same time, the PIE (PEval-IncEval-Assemble) programming model[5] is proposed. In this model, users only need to provide three functions,</p> <ul> <li>(1) PEval, a sequential (single-machine) function for given a query, computes the answer on a local partition;</li> <li>(2) IncEval, a sequential incremental function, computes changes to the old output by treating incoming messages as updates; and</li> <li>(3) Assemble, which collects partial answers, and combines them into a complete answer.</li> </ul> <p>The PIE model works on a graph G and each worker maintains a partition of G. Given a query, each worker first executes PEval against its local partition, to compute partial answers in parallel. Then each worker may exchange partial results with other workers via synchronous message passing. Upon receiving messages, each worker incrementally computes IncEval. The incremental step iterates until no further messages can be generated. At this point, Assemble pulls partial answers and assembles the final result. In this way, the PIE model parallelizes existing sequential graph algorithms, without revising their logic and workflow.</p> <p><img src="/blog/assets/images/gs-workflow.png" alt="vertex-model" /></p>

<title>Introducing GraphScope Playground</title>
<description><p><img src="/blog/assets/images/try-record.gif" alt="try-record.gif" /> Today we released <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope/releases/tag/v0.2.0">GraphScope 0.2.0</a>. With this release, we are happy to introduce <a href="http://try.graphscope.app/">GraphScope Playground</a>, a hosted JupyterLab with GraphScope ready out-of-the-box. Now you can get started with GraphScope straight away in your browser without any hassle for setting it up.</p> <h4 id="signing-in">Signing-in</h4> <p>The GraphScope Playground is built on top of <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub">JupyterHub</a>. At the moment, it only supports Github OAuth for signing-in. Please make sure you have a <a href="https://github.com/join">Github account</a> before proceed.</p> <p><img src="/blog/assets/images/try-login.gif" alt="try-login.gif" /></p> <p>Open <a href="https://try.graphscope.app/">GraphScope PlayGround</a> in your browser. You will be shown a landing page of GraphScope Playground. It only take a few clicks to get authenticated with your Github account. A JupyterLab session will be created for you in a few seconds.</p> <h4 id="in-the-playground">In the Playground</h4> <p>You will be redirected to the JupyterLab interface after signing-in. It is a modern integrated development environment for Notebooks, where documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing in Python.</p> <p><img src="/blog/assets/images/raw-playground-snapshot.png" alt="gs-snapshot" /></p> <p>On the left, there is a sidebar, where you can navigate your workspace with the file browser, as well as check the list of running kernels and terminals, the command palette, and the list of tabs in the main work area etc. One the right, it is the main work area, where tabs and panes can be created for the files and notebooks you edit. You can also open a terminal if you like.</p> <p>A JupyterLab session lives inside a docker container is specifically created for you after signing-in. The session will live for up to 120 mins (or 15 mins without user interactions). Based on the the official <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jupyterhub/singleuser:1.3</code> image, we added necessary packages, tutorials and sample datasets for running GraphScope to the Playground image. You are given 1 CPU core and 2GB memory for the JupyterLab container, and you are also given the access to a Kubernetes cluster with a limit of 16 CPU cores and 32GB memory for you to run GraphScope sessions. Following the convention of JupyterLab, the default working directory is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/jovyan/</code>, where you can find tutorials at the root, datasets under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">datasets</code> folder and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workspace</code> folder.</p> <p>You can open an existing / create a new notebook, and start coding with GraphScope straight away. If you want to access the files you edited at a later time, you can place them under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workspace</code> folder. All the changes elsewhere will be reset after session ends. We place <strong>a copy of the sample datasets</strong> on K8s hosts, which can be <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alibaba/GraphScope/blob/main/tutorials/1_how_to_launch_a_session.ipynb#Mounting-Volumes">mounted to the GraphScope pods</a>. Please note that your local edits to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/datasets</code> won’t affect the copy on K8s hosts (<em>stay tuned!</em>).</p> <h4 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h4> <p>In the GraphScope Playground, you have access to a set of comprehensive tutorials to get started with GraphScope. In the tutorials you could learn how to launch a session, to load graphs, and to run analytical analysis, interactive queries as well as graph neural network trainings in GraphScope. At the moment, we have the following tutorials included.</p> <ol> <li><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alibaba/GraphScope/blob/main/tutorials/1_how_to_launch_a_session.ipynb">How to Create a Session</a></li> <li><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alibaba/GraphScope/blob/main/tutorials/2_loading_graphs.ipynb">Loading Graphs</a></li> <li><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alibaba/GraphScope/blob/main/tutorials/3_builtin_analytical_algorithms.ipynb">Built-in Analytical Algorithms</a></li> <li><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alibaba/GraphScope/blob/main/tutorials/4_writing_your_own_algorithms.ipynb">Writing Your Own Algorithms</a></li> <li><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alibaba/GraphScope/blob/main/tutorials/5_interactive_query_with_gremlin.ipynb">Interactive Query with Gremlin</a></li> <li><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alibaba/GraphScope/blob/main/tutorials/6_unsupervised_learning_with_graphsage.ipynb">Unsupervised Learning with GraphSage</a></li> <li><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alibaba/GraphScope/blob/main/tutorials/7_supervised_learning_with_gcn.ipynb">Supervised Learning with GCN</a></li> <li><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alibaba/GraphScope/blob/main/tutorials/8_node_classification_on_citation_network.ipynb">A Complex Workflow: Node Classification on Citation Network</a></li> </ol> <h1 id="stay-tuned-for-new-features">Stay tuned for new features</h1> <p>With GraphScope Playground, we wish to make getting started with GraphScope as easy as possible. We are constantly working on improving the experience. If you have any questions or feedbacks, feel free to write a <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope/discussions">post at Github Discussions</a>.

<title>Say Hello to GraphScope!</title>
<description><p><img src="/blog/assets/images/releasing.png" alt="graphscope-releasing" /> The source code of GraphScope is released today!</p> <p>github repo: <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/graphscope">https://github.com/alibaba/graphscope</a></p> <p>GraphScope aims to provide a single system that is able to support three types of computation tasks, i.e., graph interactive query, graph analytics and graph deep learning. We carefully design GraphScope with user-friendly interface and extensible programming APIs, so that users can easily construct customized end-to-end graph processing pipelines involving different types of graph computation tasks. In specific, GraphScope fully embraces the Python and Gremlin ecosystem, and thus comes with a shallow learning curve for both data scientists and developers. Under the hood, GraphScope comprises core engines specifically optimized for each graph computation paradigm, and can smoothly orchestrate multiple engines to cooperate efficiently, avoiding the complexity of manually stitching multiple independent systems together. GraphScope can scale to ultra-large graphs, and run in industrial speed and robustness.</p> <p>GraphScope is released under Apache License 2.0. Any contributions are greatly appreciated! You may reach us at <a href="http://slack.graphscope.io/">Slack channel</a> or submit <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope/issues">GitHub issues</a>.</p> </description>
