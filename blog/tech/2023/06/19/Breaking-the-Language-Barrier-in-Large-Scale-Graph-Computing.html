In this blog, we present <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope/tree/main/analytical_engine/java"><strong>GRAPE-JDK</strong></a>,
an efficient cross-language graph analysis development kit of GraphScope. <strong>GRAPE-JDK</strong> enables users to write customized graph algorithms in Java and run them efficiently on GraphScope by addressing various challenges in cross-language graph computation.
In this way, Java algorithms developed based on <strong>GRAPE-JDK</strong> can achieve performance similar to C++ algorithms.</p>

<h3 id="the-demand-and-challenges-of-cross-language-graph-analysis">The Demand and Challenges of Cross-language Graph Analysis</h3>

<p>Graph analytics is a critical aspect of processing tasks involving graphs. 
One notable example of a graph analysis algorithm is the widely used single-source shortest path (SSSP) algorithm. 
The graph analytical engine in GraphScope is derived from <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3282488">GRAPE</a>, as documented in the research paper available at GRAPE. This engine incorporates various pre-built graph analysis algorithms, including SSSP and PageRank, among others, which users can readily invoke for their analytical needs.</p>

<p>In real-world production scenarios, customization of general algorithms is often required to accommodate specific business logic. 
As a result, developers frequently need to develop their own algorithms tailored to their needs. 
Java is widely adopted as the predominant language within big data ecosystems, making it an ideal choice for implementing these algorithms.
However, when utilizing GraphScope’s graph analytical engine, relying solely on the C++ interface can present significant obstacles for developers. 
Directly implementing algorithms in Java would be more seamless and efficient for them. 
Therefore, there exists a demand for enabling users to leverage Java for implementing customized graph algorithms and seamlessly executing them on the GraphScope graph analytical engine. 
This approach would address practical requirements while facilitating a smoother integration of user-developed algorithms into the system.</p>

<p>To meet the user’s requirement for conducting cross-language graph analysis, we have developed a Java SDK that builds upon the graph analysis engine GRAPE, which is primarily implemented in C++.
In such scenarios, a natural solution is to employ the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/">Java Native Interface (JNI)</a>, which serves as the standard framework for Foreign Function Interface (FFI) on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
By utilizing JNI, we can overcome the limitations of Java by accessing system hardware resources at a lower level, similar to C++.
To leverage JNI effectively, it requires writing wrapper code in C++ and compiling it into a dynamic library, granting us the ability to seamlessly utilize its functionalities. 
This approach facilitates the seamless integration of Java and C++ components, enabling developers to harness the full potential of both languages within the graph analysis process.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/2023-06-19-jni.jpg" alt="JNI：Briding Java and C++" height="36px" width="36px" /></p>

<p>Therefore, we can find a straightforward and intuitive solution: employing the raw JNI to create wrapper code that bridges Java and C++. 
This approach allows us to encapsulate the C++ interface of the graph computing engine as a Java interface, making it accessible to users.
However, this native solution has inherent limitations that render it inadequate for meeting the demands of large-scale graph computing. 
It confronts several challenges in following three aspects:</p>

<h4 id="challenge-1-difficulty-in-jni-programming">Challenge 1: Difficulty in JNI Programming</h4>
<p>Directly using JNI for cross-language programming poses challenges in development, debugging, and maintenance.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Development</strong>: In order to enable Java to interact/communicate with C++, programmers need to write 
a large amount of error-prone and boilerplate code, as shown in the code block. 
And JNI code often involves pointer conversion, which increases the risk of errors.</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">JNIEXPORT</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">JNICALL</span> <span class="nf">Java_com_alibaba_graphscope_stdcxx_StdVector_1cxx_10x8cbe72bf_nativeClear</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">JNIEnv</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">jclass</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">jlong</span> <span class="n">ptr</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Debugging</strong>: The written JNI code needs to be compiled into a dynamic library by a C++/C compiler
for the JVM to load and invoke the functions defined in it. The compilation and debugging of JNI code is also a painful process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Maintenance</strong>: The cost of maintaining JNI code is also high. As JNI code is highly dependent on C++ native code, 
when the C++ interface and implementation of the graph computing engine change, programmers must manually modify the JNI implementation to adapt.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="challenge-2-huge-overhead-of-cross-language-access">Challenge 2: Huge Overhead of Cross-language Access</h4>
<p>Although JNI provides sufficient APIs for communication between Java and C++, the overhead it brings 
due to its cross-language nature is huge. According to our research, the overhead that JNI may introduce in actual 
large-scale graph computing scenarios mainly comes from the following call overheads.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The overhead of JNI function calls</strong>. There is already a considerable overhead in calling the JNI function itself,
 including accessing Java Objects in the JNI code implementation, which is a very <a href="http://www.mastercorp.free.fr/Ing1/Cours/Java/java_lesson1/doc/Tutorial/performance/JPNativeCode_fm.htm">time-consuming operation</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Java native methods cannot be inlined by the JVM</strong>. In Java, optimization of code is mainly done by the JVM. For frequently called Java methods,
the JVM can avoid the overhead of function calls by inlining them. However, for native methods implemented by JNI, the JVM cannot optimize them. 
In data-intensive scenarios such as graph computing, accessing data stored in C++ memory through JNI from Java is a frequent operation. Therefore, native methods that cannot be inlined will be a significant overhead during program execution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Java native methods cannot be optimized by JIT</strong>. Native methods have already been compiled into binary code by C++/C compiler, so it is not possible for the JVM to optimize them through JIT.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="challenge-3-support-for-user-defined-data-structures">Challenge 3: Support for User-defined Data Structures</h4>

<p>In some complex real-world production scenarios,Users often have a great demand for customizing vertex data type,
edge data type, and even message types. Relying solely on JNI cannot achieve this because every time a user defines a new data type,
we need to implement it in C++ and then write JNI methods to map it to Java.</p>

<h3 id="design-and-implementation">Design and Implementation</h3>

<p>To overcome these challenges, the GraphScope team worked closely with the JVM team at Alibaba Cloud Programming Language and Compiler 
to design and implement a high-performance and user-friendly cross-language graph computing solution.
At the same time, the development of <strong>GRAPE-JDK</strong> also led to a modern and advanced FFI (Foreign Function Interface) framework: 
<strong>FastFFI</strong> (open-sourced on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/fastFFI">alibaba/fastFFI</a>. 
The position of GRAPE-SDK in the GraphScope system is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/2023-06-19-grape-jdk-pos.jpg" alt="GRAPE-JDK in GraphScope" /></p>

<h4 id="fastffi">FastFFI</h4>

<p>The functionality of <strong>GRAPE-JDK</strong> depends on <strong>FastFFI</strong>. <strong>FastFFI</strong> is a modern, advanced, and efficient Java FFI framework
whose features are derived from our exploration of cross-language programming between Java and C++ in GRAPE-JDK. 
<strong>FastFFI</strong> successfully overcomes the three challenges mentioned above.</p>

<p><strong>FastFFI</strong> can be divided into two parts, FFI-SDK and LLVM4JNI-SDK. FFI-SDK provides comprehensive JNI development support, reducing the complexity of programming. LLVM4JNI-SDK provides JNI code optimization support to improve runtime performance. For more information about FastFFI, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/fastFFI">FastFFI</a>.</p>

<h4 id="grape-jdk">GRAPE-JDK</h4>

<p>Based on the JNI support provided by FastFFI, we developed the Java PIE SDK for GRAPE: <strong>GRAPE-JDK</strong>. 
Taking Vertex as an example, we will introduce how <strong>FastFFI</strong> reduces the complexity of JNI development and improves performance.</p>

<h3 id="the-mapping-between-c-and-java-classes">The Mapping between C++ and Java Classes</h3>
<p>As the most basic abstraction in the graph, Vertex often has a unique ID and attribute (vertex data). For example, in GRAPE, the interface abstraction of a vertex is as follows</p>

<div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="nc">T</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

 <span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="n">T</span> <span class="n">value_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to map the C++ Vertex class to Java, all we need to do is to write the following code in Java.</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">@FFIGen</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">library</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"grape-jni"</span><span class="o">)</span>

<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@FFIGen</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@CXXHead</code> are both Java annotations. By providing additional information through annotations, we can generate code
during the compilation of Java code. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@CXXHead("grape/utils/vertex_array.h")</code> specifies that the generated 
C++ code needs to include the header file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grape/utils/vertex_array.h</code>.</p>

<p>After compilation, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vertex.java</code> will generate two sets of code, one of which is the implementation

<p>Similarly, we can map any C++ class to a Java class.</p>

<h4 id="ffimirroruser-defined-data-structures">FFIMirror：User-defined Data Structures</h4>

<p>In GRAPE-JDK, we support users to create a customized data structure that has no corresponding C++ implementation, and use it as the data type for vertex ID, vertex or edge. You only need to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@FFIMirror</code> annotation to decorate your own defined interface. For example, we can define a simple data structure containing only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">long</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double</code> fields.

<p>Next, similar to regular JNI projects, after compiling the obtained <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.cc</code> files and linking them into a dynamic library,
we can load them into Java through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">System.loadLibrary()</code> and access C++ objects and methods in Java</p>

<p>As we can see, the implementation of <strong>GRAPE-JDK</strong> based on <strong>FastFFI</strong> perfectly solves the difficulties in development,
debugging, and maintenance in cross-language programming with JNI, and meets the needs of users for customized data types</p>

<h3 id="optimizing-jni">Optimizing JNI</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/alibaba/fastFFI/tree/main/llvm4jni">LLVM4JNI-SDK</a> is a “BitCode to ByteCode” conversion tool implemented entirely in Java. The working principle of LLVM4JNI 
is to analyze LLVM-IR (JNI code is embedded in the dynamic library binary by using option <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D68213"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-mllvm=-lto-embed-bitcode</code></a>
when compiling with LLVM11), select the code that can be converted to Java bytecode (not all LLVM IR can be converted to bytecode), 
generate bytecode, and finally replace the corresponding Java native methods.</p>

<p>For example, for the Vertex defined earlier, when running LLVM4JNI for optimization, we will replace the native methods in the Vertex implementation class:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Vertex_cxx_0xaccf3424</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="nc">FFIPointerImpl</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="nc">Vertex</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Long</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="c1">//Notice that this a no longer a native method now!</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="nf">nativeGetValue</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">ptr</span><span class="o">){</span>
      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nc">JavaRuntime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getLong</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">var0</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>

  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">nativeSetValue</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">ptr</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">arg00</span><span class="o">){</span>
       <span class="nc">JavaRuntime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">putLong</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ptr</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">arg00</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we can see in lines 3 and 7, the original native methods are replaced with normal Java methods,
and the implementation in the methods uses JavaRuntime, which is a wrapper for Java
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNSAFE</code> in LLVM4JNI-runtime and essentially still uses UNSAFE to access off-heap memory.
By replacing native methods with Java methods, we avoid significant overhead in JNI calls</p>

<h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>

<p>By exposing only a simple programming model interface, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParallelAppBase</code>, we can hide the complex implementation of GRAPE-JDK.
Users do not need to know anything about the underlying implementation. They only need to inherit the interface and implement 
the two methods, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PEval</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IncEval</code>, to run the algorithm on the GraphScope graph analysis engine.

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>To verify the running performance of <strong>GRAPE-JDK</strong> in large-scale graph computing scenarios, 
we conducted tests on datasets with hundreds of millions of vertices and billions of edges provided by <a href="https://graphalytics.org/">LDBC Graphalytics</a>
for various common algorithms.
The test configuration was 4 clusters with 400GB of memory and 96 cores, and 4 GraphScope workers. 
For specific performance test report results, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope/blob/main/analytical_engine/java/performance.md">GRAPE-JDK performance report</a>.
Here we take the SSSP and PageRank algorithms as examples to show the experimental results.</p>

<h4 id="java-app-vs-c-app">Java App vs C++ App</h4>

<p>First, we compare the performance gap between the Java-SSSP algorithm based on <strong>GRAPE-JDK</strong> and the CPP-SSSP algorithm based on libgrape-lite on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">com-fiendster</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Datagen-9_0-fb</code> datasets. We can see that the overall performance gap between the Java app and the C++ app is about 2 times.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/2023-06-19-perf-datagen.jpg" alt="SSSP on Dategen-9_0-fb" />
<img src="/blog/assets/images/2023-06-19-perf-com.jpg" alt="SSSP on ccom-friendster" /></p>

<h4 id="performance-improvement-brought-by-llvm4jni">Performance Improvement Brought by LLVM4JNI</h4>

<p>LLVM4JNI has brought significant performance improvements to <strong>GRAPE-JDK</strong>. As shown in the table below, the Java-PageRank algorithm 
implemented using <strong>GRAPE-JDK</strong> is now approaching the performance of CPP-PageRank. In cases with high concurrency, 
the time is very close to C++ (such as the column with a concurrency of 32 in the second table).</p>

<p>Performance result is shown in the following two tables.</p>
