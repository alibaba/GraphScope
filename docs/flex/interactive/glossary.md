### Stored Procedure.
A stored procedure (also termed proc, storp, sproc, StoPro, StoredProc, StoreProc, sp, or SP) is a subroutine available to applications that access a relational database management system (RDBMS). Such procedures are stored in the database data dictionary(from wikipedia). 

In GraphScope Interactive, a cypher query with parameters (denote with $ prefix) or a piece of c++ code can be registered as a stored procedure.

### Gremlin

[Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html) is the graph traversal language of Apache TinkerPop. Gremlin is a functional, data-flow language that enables users to succinctly express complex traversals on (or queries of) their application's property graph. Every Gremlin traversal is composed of a sequence of (potentially nested) steps.
