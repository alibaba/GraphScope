# Glossary

This page lists all the golssary used in the GraphScope project.

- **GRAPE**: the code name of analytical engine in GraphScope. It was first indroduced in the SIGMOD2017 paper, represents <u>GRA</u>ph <u>P</u>arallel processing <u>E</u>ngine. The analytical engine inherits the design proposed in this paper.
- **GAE**: short for GraphScope Anlaytical Engine, a.k.a., GRAPE.
- **Groot**: the code name of the persisitent storage in GraphScope. It was named after the tree Groot in the movie "Guardians of the Galaxy". In addition, the name g-root also indicates the foundamental role of the storage component in the system.
- **vineyard**: the code name of the immutable memory mangement.
- **GAIA**: TBF.
- **GAIA-IR**: enhanced version of GAIA, with support of intermediate representation. 
- **Pegasus**: the code name of runtime engine under the GAIA.
- **PIE-model**: the subgraph centric programming model proposed in GRAPE, which is short for <u>P</u>artial evaluation, <u>I</u>ncremental evaluation and assembl<u>E</u>, the three core functions to fulfill in GRAPE.
- **GAS-model**: A typical programming model proposed for graph computing by GraphLab. It asks programmers to "think like a vertex", and fulfill three functions, namely <u>G</u>ather, <u>A</u>pply and <u>S</u>catter, when writing graph algorithms.
- **FLASH**:
- **Ingress**:
