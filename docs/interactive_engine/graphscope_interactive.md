# GraphScope Interactive

GraphScope Interactive is a graph system designed to handle concurrent graph queries at an impressive speed. It has three key features.
- High-QPS Scenario Handling: GraphScope Interactive is built upon GraphScope Flex, which is designed to handle high-QPS scenarios. This allows GraphScope Interactive to process a large number of queries in a short amount of time

- Support for Cypher and C++: GraphScope Interactive supports using [Cypher](https://opencypher.org/) for ad-hoc queries, and both Cypher and C++ for registering stored procedures.
