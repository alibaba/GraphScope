# Getting Started

This guide gives you a quick start to use GraphScope for graph interactive tasks on your local machine.

## Installation

Weâ€™ll start by installing GraphScope with a single-line command.

```bash

python3 -m pip install graphscope --upgrade

```

````{tip}
If the download is very slow, try to use a mirror site for the pip.

```bash
python3 -m pip install graphscope --upgrade \
    -i http://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/ --trusted-host=mirrors.aliyun.com
```

## Running GraphScope Interactive Engine on Local

It's fairly straightforward to run interactive queries using the `graphscope` package on
your local machine. First of all, you import `graphscope` in a Python session, and load
the modern graph, which has been widely used in [Tinkerpop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.6.2/tutorials/getting-started/) demos.


```python
import graphscope as gs
from graphscope.dataset.modern_graph import load_modern_graph

gs.set_option(show_log=True)

# load the modern graph as example.
graph = load_modern_graph()

# Hereafter, you can use the `graph` object to create an `gremlin` query session
g = gs.gremlin(graph)
# then `execute` any supported gremlin query.
q1 = g.execute('g.V().count()')
print(q1.all())   # should print [6]

q2 = g.execute('g.V().hasLabel(\'person\')')
print(q2.all())  # should print [[v[2], v[3], v[0], v[1]]]
```

You may see something like:
```Shell
...
... [INFO][coordinator:453]: Built interactive frontend xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:pppp for graph xxx
... [INFO][op_executor:455]: execute gremlin query
[6]
...
... [INFO][op_executor:455]: execute gremlin query
[v[2], v[3], v[0], v[1]]
...
```

The number 6 is printed, which is the number of vertices in modern graph.


## What's the Next
As shown in the above example, it is very easy to use GraphScope to interactively query a graph using the gremlin query language on your local machine. You may find more tutorials [here](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/tutorials/getting-started/) for the basic Gremlin usage, in which most read-only queries can be seamlessly executed with the above `g.execute()` function.

In addition to the above local-machine entr\'ee, we have prepared the following topics for your reference.

- GIE can process LDBC interactive complex workloads. [A walk-through tutorial is here](./ldbc_tutorial)
- GIE can work in a distributed environment to process very large graph. [How to do that?](./deployment)
- GIE has supported a lot of standard Gremlin steps, together with many useful syntactic sugars. [Please look into the details](./supported_gremlin_steps)
- Want to know more about the technical details of GIE. [This is the design and architecture of GIE](./design_of_gie)
