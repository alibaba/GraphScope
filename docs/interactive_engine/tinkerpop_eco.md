# Apache TinkerPop Ecosystem
GIE is a system that seamlessly integrates with the [Apache TinkerPop]((http://tinkerpop.apache.org/)) ecosystem,
which is an open framework for developing interactive graph applications using the gremlin query language.
By implementing TinkerPop's gremlin [Server]((https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-server)) interface,
GIE allows for easy interaction with client/development tools such as gremlin console and language
wrappers such as Java and Python.

The following documentations will guide you through empowering the Tinkerpop ecosystem
with GIE's distributed capability for large-scale graph.
