# Apache TinkerPop Ecosystem
[Apache TinkerPop](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/) is an open framework for developing interactive
graph applications using the Gremlin query language. GIE implements TinkerPop's [Gremlin Server](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-server) interface
so that the system can seamlessly interact with the TinkerPop ecosystem, including client/development tools such as
[Gremlin Console] (https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-console) and
language wrappers such as Java and Python. The following documentations will guide you through using GIE
for your Tinkerpop applications.

GIE is a system that seamlessly integrates with the [Apache TinkerPop]((http://tinkerpop.apache.org/)) ecosystem,
which is an open framework for developing interactive graph applications using the gremlin query language.
By implementing TinkerPop's gremlin [Server]((https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-server)) interface,
GIE allows for easy interaction with client/development tools such as gremlin Console and language
wrappers such as Java and Python. If you're interested in empowering your existing gremlin applications
with the distributed capability of GIE, the following documentations will guide you through the process.
