# Glossary

This page lists all the golssary used in the GraphScope project.

#### GRAPE

the code name of analytical engine in GraphScope. It was first indroduced in the SIGMOD2017 paper, represents <u>GRA</u>ph <u>P</u>arallel processing <u>E</u>ngine. The analytical engine inherits the design proposed in this paper.

#### GAE

short for GraphScope Anlaytical Engine, a.k.a., GRAPE.


#### Groot

the code name of the persisitent storage in GraphScope. It was named after the tree Groot in the movie "Guardians of the Galaxy". In addition, the name g-root also indicates the foundamental role of the storage component in the system.

#### vineyard

the code name of the immutable memory mangement.



#### GAIA


#### GAIA-IR

enhanced version of GAIA, with support of intermediate representation. 


#### Pegasus

the code name of runtime engine under the GAIA.

#### PIE-model

The subgraph centric programming model proposed in GRAPE, which is short for <u>P</u>artial evaluation, <u>I</u>ncremental evaluation and assembl<u>E</u>, the three core functions to fulfill in GRAPE.

#### GAS-model
A typical programming model proposed for graph computing by GraphLab. It asks programmers to "think like a vertex", and fulfill three functions, namely <u>G</u>ather, <u>A</u>pply and <u>S</u>catter, when writing graph algorithms.

#### FLASH
