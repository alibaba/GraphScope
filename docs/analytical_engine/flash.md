# Programming Model: FLASH

FLASH is a distributed framework for programming a broad spectrum of graph algorithms, including clustering, centrality, traversal, matching, mining, etc. Based on its high-level interface and an efficient system implementation, FLASH achieves good expressiveness, productivity and efficiency at the same time. FLASH follows the vertex-centric philosophy, but it moves a step further for stronger expressiveness by providing flexible control flow, the operations on arbitrary vertex sets and beyond-neighborhood communication. FLASH makes diverse complex graph algorithms easy to write at the distributed runtime. The algorithms expressed in FLASH take only a few lines of code, and provide a satisfactory performance.
