# Design of Analytical Engine

Graph Analytical Engine (GAE) of GraphScope is used to handle various graph analytics algorithms. GAE derives from [GRAPE](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3282488), a graph processing system proposed on SIGMOD 2017, and is further enhanced by introducing a lot of new features, including supporting more types of graph storages, more programming models and programming languages, more computation patterns and better integration with other graph processing systems and big data systems.
