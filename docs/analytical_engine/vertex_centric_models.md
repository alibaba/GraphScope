## Simulation of Pregel Model in Analytical Engine

As we proved in the paper, the analytical engine is able to simulate the vertex centric models. We have implemented the support for Pregel model in the analytical engine, and you can use the Pregel API to write your own algorithms. In addition, if you already have your graph applications implemented in Giraph or GraphX, you can run them on GraphScope directly. Better still, the analytical engine can achieve better performance than Giraph and GraphX.
