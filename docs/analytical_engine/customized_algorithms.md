# Customized Algorithms

In addition to the built-in algorithms, GraphScope also provides a way to run your own algorithms on the analytical engine. The analytical engine is designed to be extensible, hence you can implement your own algorithms in PIE or FLASH model, in Java„ÄÅC++ or Python, and run them on GraphScope.
