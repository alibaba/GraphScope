# NetworkX Compatibility

NetworkX is a Python package for manipulating and processing graph data on a single machine. It provides user-friendly interfaces for working with graph data and developing graph-based applications. Currently, it is widely used by graph application developers and researchers, particularly in the field of data science. However, it does not have the capability to handle large-scale graphs on a distributed environment.

To solve this problem, GraphScope provides a NetworkX-compatible interface, which allows users who have used NetworkX for their graph analysis on small graphs to use GraphScope for large graphs with minimal changes.
