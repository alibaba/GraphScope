# Built-in Algorithms

GraphScope anlaytical engine provides many built-in algorithms, which enables users to analysis their graph data with least effort. The algorithms covers the most common analytics tasks, such as short paths, community detection, clustering, centralities, etc. The algorithms are implemented in PIE and optimized to best performance, users can use them in the out-of-box manner.

Here are the full list of supported algorithms:

## Weakly Connected Components(WCC)

Weakly Connected Components(WCC) is a community detection algorithm, which is used to find the connected components in a graph. 


## Single Sourced Shortest Path(SSSP)
