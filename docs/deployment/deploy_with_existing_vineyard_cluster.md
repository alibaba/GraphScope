# Depoly with Existing Vineyard Cluster

If you have already deployed a vineyard cluster, you can easily deploy GraphScope on the existing cluster and reuse the vineyard data such as graph with several GraphScope sessions. This will allow you to load a graph to the existing vineyard cluster and then reuse it with multiple GraphScope sessions, without needing to deploy a separate vineyard cluster for each session.

This doc provides step-by-step instructions on how to do this.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Linux or macOS.
- Python 3.7 ~ 3.11.

## Install GraphScope Client

The deployment of GraphScope is managed by python API, please make sure you have already installed the GraphScope python package.

```bash
python3 -m pip install graphscope-client
```

Refer to [Install GraphScope Client](./deploy_graphscope_on_self_managed_k8s.md#install-graphscope-client) for details.

## Prepare a Kubernetes cluster

If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster by hand, we recommend using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

Please refer to [Prepare a Kubernetes cluster](./deploy_graphscope_on_self_managed_k8s.md#prepare-a-kubernetes-cluster) for details.

## Deploy a Vineyard Cluster

To simplify the deployment of vineyard cluster, you need to install the vineyard package.

```bash
python3 -m pip install vineyard
```

By default, the Vineyard cluster consists of three Vineyard instances and three etcd instances. 
However, since we only have one node in the Kubernetes cluster, we need to specify the number of Vineyard instances and etcd instances using the `vineyard_replicas` and `vineyard_etcd_replicas` parameters. 
To deploy a simple Vineyard cluster with one Vineyard instance and one etcd instance, follow the next step:

```python
import vineyard

vineyard.deploy.vineyardctl.deploy.vineyard_deployment(
    vineyard_replicas=1, 
    vineyard_etcd_replicas=1, 
    create_namespace=True
)
```

Then you can get a vineyard cluster with one vineyard instance and one etcd instance in the namespace `vineyard-system`.

Check all vineyard pods as follows.

```bash
$ kubectl get pod -n vineyard-system   
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
etcd0                              1/1     Running   0          73m
vineyardd-sample-5db59987f-vr2fg   1/1     Running   0          73m
```

## Load the dataset to the Kubernetes cluster

Depending on how the Kubernetes cluster was created, you may need to take different steps to make your dataset available within the cluster. If the cluster was not created using minikube, you will need to either copy the dataset to the nodes of the Kubernetes cluster or mount it onto them. On the other hand, if the cluster was created using minikube, you can directly mount the dataset to the minikube VM, without the need for further copying or mounting operations.

Download the dataset to the local machine.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/GraphScope/gstest.git
```

Then mount the dataset to the minikube VM.

````{tip}
The mount process must stay alive for the mount to be accessible. Please don't stop the mount process until the graph is loaded to the vineyard cluster.
````

```bash
$ minikube mount $(pwd)/gstest:/testingdata
```

## Load a graph to the existing vineyard cluster

You can create a GraphScope session and then specify the `k8s_namespace` and `k8s_vineyard_deployment` to which vineyard cluster you want to connect. Then load a graph to the existing vineyard cluster as follows. Once the graph is loaded, you can obtain its vineyard ID to reload it with another GraphScope session.

```python
import os
import graphscope
from graphscope.dataset import load_modern_graph

k8s_volumes = {
    "data": {
        "type": "hostPath",
        "field": {
            "path": "/testingdata",
            "type": "Directory"
        },
        "mounts": {
        "mountPath": "/testingdata"
        }
    }
}

# the step will be long as it will create a graphscope cluster
sess = graphscope.session(
    k8s_namespace='vineyard-system',
    k8s_vineyard_deployment='vineyardd-sample',
    k8s_volumes=k8s_volumes
)

# load a graph to the vineyard cluster
graph = load_modern_graph(sess, "/testingdata/modern_graph")

# print the vineyard id of the graph
print(graph.vineyard_id)
```

## Connect to the existing vineyard cluster with another GraphScope session

Create a new GraphScope session and specify the `k8s_namespace` and `k8s_vineyard_deployment` to the vineyard
cluster the last GraphScope session connected to. Also, you need to remember the vineyard id of the graph and 
then load the graph with the vineyard id in the new GraphScope session.


```python
import graphscope

# the step will be long as it will create a graphscope cluster
new_sess = graphscope.session(
    k8s_namespace='vineyard-system', 
    k8s_vineyard_deployment='vineyardd-sample',
)

# Use the vineyard id of the graph the last GraphScope session loaded
# assume the vineyard id is 22731319746904674, you can load it as follows
graph = new_sess.load_from(vineyard_id=22731319746904674)
```

Check the graph as follows.
```python
>> graph

graphscope.Graph
ARROW_PROPERTY
VERTEX: person
VERTEX: software
EDGE: knows     src: person     dst: person
EDGE: created   src: person     dst: software
```

If you see the output above, that means you have successfully reused the existing graph within the vineyard cluster using a new GraphScope session. Then you can run various graph algorithms on it.

## Cleaning up

Delete the Vineyard cluster by

```python
vineyard.deploy.vineyardctl.delete.vineyard_deployment()
```

Delete the GraphScope cluster by

```python
sess.close()
```

```python
new_sess.close()
```

Delete the kubernetes cluster created by the minikube as follows.

```bash
minikube delete
```
