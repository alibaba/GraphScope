GraphScope: A One-Stop Large-Scale Graph Computing System from Alibaba
==================================================

GraphScope is a unified distributed graph computing platform 
that provides a one-stop environment for performing diverse graph 
operations on a cluster of computers through a user-friendly 
Python interface. GraphScope makes multi-staged processing of 
large-scale graph data on compute clusters simple by combining 
several important pieces of Alibaba technology: including GRAPE, 
GraphCompute, and Graph-Learn (GL) for analytics, interactive, 
and graph neural networks (GNN) computation, respectively, 
and the vineyard store that offers efficient in-memory data transfers.
