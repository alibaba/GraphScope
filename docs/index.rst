GraphScope: A One-Stop Large-Scale Graph Computing System from Alibaba
======================================================================

GraphScope is a unified distributed graph computing platform
that provides a one-stop environment for performing diverse graph
operations on a cluster of computers through a user-friendly
Python interface. GraphScope makes multi-staged processing of
large-scale graph data on compute clusters simple by combining
several important pieces of Alibaba technology: including GRAPE,
GraphCompute, and Graph-Learn (GL) for analytics, interactive,
and graph neural networks (GNN) computation, respectively,
and the vineyard store that offers efficient in-memory data transfers.
