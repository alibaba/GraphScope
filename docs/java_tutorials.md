# Tutorials for Java Users

Apart from the Java ``PIE`` interface exposed by ``GRAPE-jdk``, efforts have also been made to 
integrate Graphscope with some famous Graph computing systems, like Apache Giraph, Apache GraphX. 
So not only do the users run java algorithms developed with ``GRAPE-jdk`` on GraphScope, 
but also they can run existing graph algorithms developed for Giraph or GraphX on GraphScope.

Follow the tutorials below, give it a shot on trying exploring GraphScope Java.

- [Graphscope integration with Apache Giraph](./java_tutorial_1_giraph.md)
- [GraphScope integration with Apache GraphX ](./java_tutorial_2_graphx.md)
