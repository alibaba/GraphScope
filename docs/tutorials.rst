Tutorials
=========

We provide a set of comprehensive tutorials for users to get started with GraphScope. In the tutorials you could learn
how to launch a session, to load graphs, and to run analytical analysis, interactive queries as well as graph neural
network trainings using GAE, GIE and GLE in GraphScope.

The tutorials are organized as jupyter notebooks. Users can try them in any jupyter notebook servers. You could play
with those tutorials using our well-prepared jupyterlab environment in `GraphScope Playground <https://try.graphscope.app>`_.

All tutorials are listed as follows:
