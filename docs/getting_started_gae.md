# Getting Started for GAE
This tutorial will give you a quick tour of GraphScope's GAE. To get started, weâ€™ll start by installing GraphScope on local with `python3 -m pip install graphscope --upgrade`. The examples in this guide are based on Python.

## Installing Environments for Compilation 
For better performance, the built-in graph analytics algorithms are written in C++. Therefore, we need to install necessary environments for compilation first. We have provided a script to install all required dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alibaba/GraphScope.git
cd GraphScope
./scripts/install_deps.sh --dev
```

## Loading Graph Data
After that, we can load a build-in graph into GraphScope:

```python
import graphscope
from graphscope.dataset import load_ogbn_mag
g = load_ogbn_mag()
```

If you need to load your own dataset, please check out our detailed [introduction to how to load graph data](https://graphscope.io/docs/latest/how_to_load_graphs.html).

## Running Built-in Graph Analytics Algorithms
GAE of GraphScope provides 20 graph analytics algorithms as built-in algorithms, and users can directly invoke them. The build-in algorithms contain most commonly used algorithms, including PageRank, BFS, DFS, shortest path and LCC. For example, we can run PageRank with:

```python
result = graphscope.pagerank(g)
print(result)
``` 

## Running NexworkX Graph Algorithms

GraphScope is compatible with NetworkX APIs, and thus a graph algorithm developed for NetworkX (e.g., degree centrality) can directly on GraphScope:

```python
import graphscope.nx as nx
G = nx.Graph(g)
nx.degree_centrality(G)
```

More details about NetworkX algorithms can refer to [this](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/index.html).

## Storing Results

Users can store the outputs of graph analytics algorithms as dataframe format for further processing:

```python
# result = graphscope.pagerank(g)
result.to_dataframe({"node": "v.id", "r": "r"})
```
