## Installation & Usage

### pip install

Currently not support, can only be built from source.

### Setuptools

Install via [Setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).

```sh
python setup.py install --user
```
(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)

Then import the package:
```python
import gs_interactive
```

### Tests

Execute `pytest` to run the tests.

## Getting Started

First, install and start the interactive service via [Interactive Getting Started](https://graphscope.io/docs/flex/interactive/getting_started), and you will get the endpoint for the Interactive service.

```bash
Interactive Service is listening at ${INTERACTIVE_ADMIN_ENDPOINT}.
```

Then, connect to the interactive endpoint, and try to run a simple query with following code.

```python

from gs_interactive.client.driver import Driver

# replace endpoint with the actual interactive endpoint, this is mock server just for testing.
interactive_endpoint='https://virtserver.swaggerhub.com/GRAPHSCOPE/interactive/1.0.0/'
driver = Driver(endpoint=interactive_endpoint)

# Interactive will initially start on a builtin modern graph. You can run a simple cypher query
with driver.getNeo4jSession() as session:
    resp = session.run('MATCH(n) RETURN COUNT(n);')
    for record in resp:
        print('record: ', record)
        # record:  <Record $f0=6>
```
