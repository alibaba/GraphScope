# Vertex MultiSet

- RowVertexSet: A simple Vertex Multi-set stores vertex handles of one label, may contains replicated vertices.
- TwoLabelVertexSet: Stores vertex handles of vertices from two labels.
- MultiLabelVertexSet: Stores vertex handles of vertices from multiple labels. Vertices from different labels are stored separately.
- GeneralVertexSet: Stores vertex handles of vertices from multiple labels. 
Vertices from different labels are stored in a mixed manner.
