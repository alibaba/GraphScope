 * In common cases, the result object returned by {@code ExpressionVisitor} is a simple {@code RexNode},
 * but there exists more complex situations:
 * there is as least one aggregate call in an expression, i.e. count(n.age) + 2, count(n.age) + sum(n.age).
 * In real-execution, count(n.age) or sum(n.age) need to be calculated first, which the latter project is based on.
 * {@code ExpressionVisitor} will return a list of aggregate calls (aggregate in advance) with a project expression to handle the case.
