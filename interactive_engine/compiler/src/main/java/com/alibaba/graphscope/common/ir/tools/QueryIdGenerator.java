     * The function is to assign a unique job id for the query, which needs to ensure uniqueness in time and space.
     * Specifically, for queries a and b, the following two cases are required to not produce duplicate plan ids:
     *  1. When query a and b are sent to the same frontend but at different times;
     *  2. When query a and b are sent to different frontends, regardless if the timestamps are the same or not;
     *
     * This requires us to implement the functionality of UUID. The default Java {@link java.util.UUID} is composed of 128 bits,
     * with the first 64 bits determined by timestamp and the latter 64 bits composed of MAC address plus other items.
     * However, our job id is made up of 64 bits, and converting 128 bits into 64 bits might compromise the uniqueness of the id;
     *
     * Therefore, we adopt another method similar to random number generation. We use Javaâ€™s built-in {@link java.security.SecureRandom},
     * which can directly generate a random 64-bit id through {@link SecureRandom#nextLong()}. SecureRandom is a method of pseudo-random generation,
     * that is, deterministic generation of a random sequence with a random seed determined by a combination of timestamp + machine physical properties,
     * which basically meets our needs for plan id.
     *
     * @return Here, we use {@link BigInteger} to store the returned 64-bit UUID, which will be further converted to uint64 when being sent to the Pegasus engine.
