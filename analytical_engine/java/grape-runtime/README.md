# GraphScope runtime
This folder contains the implementation of **```GraphScope Java runtime```**.

If you just want to implement your java app and run it on ```GraphScope``` 
Analytical Engine, you have nothing to know about this directory. You Just need
to download Grape-jdk, write your own app with the programming interfaces, and invoke 
```Graphscope.JavaApp``` to run your java app.

In fact, this directory just contains some runtime-needed java utilities to 
run your Java App on ```GraphScope``` Analytical Engine.
