/**
 * Implementation of the HCC algorithm that identifies connected components and assigns each vertex
 * its "component identifier" (the smallest vertex id in the component)
 * <p>
 * The idea behind the algorithm is very simple: propagate the smallest vertex id along the edges to
 * all vertices of a connected component. The number of supersteps necessary is equal to the length
 * of the maximum diameter of all components + 1
 * <p>
 * The original Hadoop-based variant of this algorithm was proposed by Kang, Charalampos,
 * Tsourakakis and Faloutsos in "PEGASUS: Mining Peta-Scale Graphs", 2010
