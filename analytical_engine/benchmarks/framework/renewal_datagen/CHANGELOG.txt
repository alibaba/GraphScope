v0.2.7 CHANGELOG

- Added gscale option which allows specifying the size of the generated dataset
based on the graphalytics scaling metric.

- Fixed a bug which caused wrong serialization of data once the numPartitions
parameter was larger than 1.

- Integrated codacy and fixed a zillion of coding style issues

- Updated license header and added it to those files where it was missing

- Fixed a Bug causing the distribution of population to be wrong. Added a test
  for this

- Fixed a Bug causing the distribution of posts per country to be wrong. Added a
  test for this

- Fixed several bugs related to date generation of dependent events. Added a
  test for this

v0.2.6 CHANGELOG
Bi parameter generation
Added testing
 -Added tests for data integrity (ids are valid, unique, etc.)
 -Added tests for interactive workload parameter bindings
 -Added tests for update streams proper sorting
 -Added a test script for automatic test of determinism for pseudo-/distributed execution modes. This script must be manually executed outside the testing framework
Improved performance of activity generation.
 -Execution flow within activity generation is changed to shape things better for the java compiler
 -Improved factor storage, releasing used memory when factors are no longer needed. This makes activity generation to scale close to linear with respect to the network's size
Improved performance of sorting update streams and serialization
Added the option to turn on/off printing the endline separator on csv serializers
Added the option to override the way weights of edges are computed
Added the option to override the way dates and datetimes are formatted
Added the graphalytics extended serializer including weights and timestamps
Added the option to override the way text of posts and comments is generated
Improved tunable clustering coefficient edge generation
Integrated parameter generation within java execution
Added the option to enable/disable the sorting of persons prior to serialization (Enabled by default)
Improved the way Exceptions are handled
Critical Bug fixing
 -Fixed a bug that caused corrupted data when a reducer failed to execute and hadoop retried its execution in another node
 -Fixed a bug with factors generation, causing some queries not to produce valid parameters
 -Fixed a bug causing message lengths to go beyond the maximum size of 2000 characters
 -Fixed bugs at ttl serializer
