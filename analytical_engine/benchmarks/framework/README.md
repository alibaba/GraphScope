## Overview

**Graph-Analytics-Benchmarks** accompanies the paper [“Revisiting Graph Analytics Benchmark”](https://doi.org/10.1145/3725345), which introduces a new benchmark suite for cross-platform graph analytics.  
The paper argues that existing suites (e.g., LDBC Graphalytics) fall short in fully capturing differences across platforms, and proposes a benchmark enabling fair, scalable, and reproducible comparisons.

**This repository provides three main components:**
- **Failure-Free Trial Data Generator (FFT-DG)**:  
  A lightweight, failure-immune data generator with independent control over **scale**, **density**, and **diameter**. Supports multiple output formats (including weighted/unweighted edge lists).
- **LLM-based API Usability Evaluation**:  
  A multi-level LLM framework for automatically generating and evaluating algorithm implementations across platforms, producing multi-dimensional quality scores and replacing costly human studies (packaged in Docker for one-command execution).
- **Performance Evaluation Scripts**:  
  Reproducible experiment setup in **Kubernetes + Docker**, with distributed jobs scheduled by the **Kubeflow MPI Operator (MPIJob)**. Provides unified reporting on **timing, throughput (edges/s), scalability, and robustness**.

**Algorithm Coverage (8 representative algorithms):**  
PageRank (PR), Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP), Triangle Counting (TC), Betweenness Centrality (BC), K-Core (KC), Community Detection (CD), Label Propagation (LPA), Weakly Connected Components (WCC).

**Supported Platforms and Execution Modes:**
- **Kubernetes + MPI**: Flash, Ligra, Grape  
- **Kubernetes + MPI + Hadoop**: Pregel+, Gthinker, PowerGraph  
- **Spark-based**: GraphX (requires Spark 2.4.x / Scala 2.11 / Hadoop 2.7 / Java 8)

**Intended Audience:**  
Researchers, practitioners, and educators in graph systems and distributed computing who require reproducible, apples-to-apples comparisons and system tuning under consistent conditions.

## Quick Start


### Prerequisites

- **python3 3.8+** (recommended: 3.10/3.11)  
- **Docker** (required for `llm-eval` and platform images)  
- **Kubernetes + MPI Operator + Hadoop** (for distributed experiments)  
- (GraphX only) **Java 8 / Scala 2.11 / Spark 2.4.x (Hadoop 2.7)**

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Configure environment variables (for llm-eval)
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env to set OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxx
```

> If using the offline Docker image (e.g., `llm-eval.tar`):  
> ```bash
> docker load -i llm-eval.tar
> ```


### Commands

#### Global help
```bash
python3 cli.py --help
```

#### `datagen` Data Generation

##### Requirements
We provide a lightweight C++ program (download from [Data_Generator.zip](https://graphscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/benchmark_datasets/Data_Generator.zip)) to generate data. Download and unzip to the `Data_Generator/` folder. We also provide a [LDBC-version of our generator](https://github.com/Lingkai981/Graph-Analytics-Benchmarks/tree/e2377e5a5a1e752ed3db44c58b8c95afc80ae030/renewal_datagen) consists of only a few modification.

##### Usage
```bash
python3 cli.py datagen --scale <8|9|10|custom>   --platform <flash|ligra|grape|gthinker|pregel+|powergraph|graphx>   --feature <Standard|Density|Diameter>
```

- Automatically compiles and runs `FFT-DG.cpp` in `Data_Generator/`.
- Produces platform-specific datasets.

##### Example
```bash
python3 cli.py datagen --scale 9 --platform flash --feature Standard
```

---

#### `llm-eval` LLM Usability Evaluation

##### Requirements
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in `.env` or system environment.
- Docker image `[llm-eval.tar](https://graphscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/benchmark_datasets/llm-eval.tar)` available. 

##### Usage
```bash
docker load -i llm-eval.tar
python3 cli.py llm-eval --platform <platform> --algorithm <algorithm>
```

##### Example
```bash
python3 cli.py llm-eval --platform flash --algorithm pagerank
```

---

#### `perf-eval` Performance Evaluation

##### Requirements
- All performance experiments are conducted in a properly configured **Kubernetes + MPI Operator (MPIJob) + Hadoop** environment to ensure reproducibility and consistency.  
- **GraphX** experiments additionally require a properly configured **Spark environment** (Spark 2.4.x, Scala 2.11, Hadoop 2.7, Java 8).
- Download and load the Docker image of different platforms on all machines:
   - [Flash](https://graphscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/benchmark_datasets/flash-mpi-v0.4.tar)
   - [Ligra](https://graphscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/benchmark_datasets/ligra-mpi-v0.1.tar)

   - [PowerGraph](https://graphscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/benchmark_datasets/graphlab-mpi-v0.1.tar)
- On all machines, create identical folders to store datasets. Then, download [the datasets](#datasets--formats) we provide, which conform to the platform specifications (and unzip for Flash), and place them into identical folders on all machines.
- For **GraphX**, build a dedicated `GraphX/` folder, then place the following `.jar` files and command files into it before executing the command to run the algorithm:
   - `pagerank`([[`.jar` file]](https://graphscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/benchmark_datasets/pagerankexample_2.11-0.1.jar) [[Command]](https://graphscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/benchmark_datasets/pagerank.sh))

   - `cc`([[`.jar` file]](https://graphscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/benchmark_datasets/connectedcomponentexample_2.11-0.1.jar) [[Command]](https://graphscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/benchmark_datasets/connectedcomponent.sh))
   - `betweenness`([[`.jar` file]](https://graphscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/benchmark_datasets/betweennesscentralityexample_2.11-0.1.jar) [[Command]](https://graphscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/benchmark_datasets/betweennesscentrality.sh))
