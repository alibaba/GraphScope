Here is the detailed information about the main API functions used in the provided code segment, including parameter descriptions and usage examples.

1. NodeGroup
Description: Represents a subset of vertices in the graph.

Parameters:

numVertices: Total number of vertices in the graph.
start: Initial vertex for the frontier.
Usage Example:

NodeGroup Frontier(n, start); // Initialize frontier with the starting vertex
2. processEdges
Description: Applies a function to edges in the graph, allowing for parallel processing of edges.

Parameters:

graph: The graph on which to perform the edge map.
NodeGroup: The subset of vertices to process.
function: The function to apply to the edges.
threshold: The threshold for switching between dense and sparse representations.
flags: Flags for controlling the behavior of the edge map (e.g., dense_forward).
Usage Example:

NodeGroup output = processEdges(GA, Frontier, BF_F(ShortestPathLen, Visited), GA.m / 20, dense_forward);
3. processNodes
Description: Applies a function to vertices in a subset.

Parameters:

NodeGroup: The subset of vertices to process.
function: The function to apply to the vertices.
Usage Example:

processNodes(output, BF_Vertex_F(Visited)); // Apply BF_Vertex_F to each vertex in the subset

NodeGroup Frontier(n, start); // Initialize the frontier with the starting vertex

Struct Definitions and Functions
