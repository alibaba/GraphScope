    Args:
        graph (:class:`graphscope.Graph`): A simple graph.
        delta (float, optional): Dumping factor. Defaults to 0.85.
        max_round (int, optional): Maximum number of rounds. Defaults to 10.

        :class:`graphscope.framework.context.VertexDataContextDAGNode`:
            A context with each vertex assigned with the pagerank value, evaluated in eager mode.

    Examples:

    .. code:: python

        >>> import graphscope

        >>> sess = graphscope.session(cluster_type="hosts", mode="eager")
