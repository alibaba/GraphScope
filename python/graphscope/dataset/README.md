# Builtin Graph Datasets

GraphScope provides a robust graph loading module to load a graph from a set of files. 

It also ships with a dataset download module, with pre-configured schemas for known datasets as sample data.

Currently, the supported graph datasets are listed as below. 

- [ogb-mag](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-mag)
- [TBF](#)


The list is growing. Hopefully, it would support all datasets from [ogb](https://ogb.stanford.edu) and [snap](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html). [Pull requests](#) are welcome!
