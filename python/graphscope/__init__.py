GraphScope - A unified distributed graph computing platform
=====================================================================

GraphScope provides a one-stop environment for performing diverse graph
operations on a cluster of computers through a user-friendly Python interface.
GraphScope makes multi-staged processing of large-scale graph data on compute
clusters simple by combining several important pieces of Alibaba technology:
including GRAPE, MaxGraph, and Graph-Learn (GL) for analytics, interactive, 
and graph neural networks (GNN) computation, respectively, and
the vineyard store that offers efficient in-memory data transfers.

Main Components
---------------

Here are the main components that GraphScope includes:

  - Graph Interactive Engine (GIE): a parallel interactive engine for graph traversal

  - Graph Analytical Engine (GAE): a high-performance graph analytics engine

  - Graph Learning Engine (GLE): an end-to-end graph learning framework
