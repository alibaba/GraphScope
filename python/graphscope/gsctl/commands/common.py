Disclaimer: The `estimate` command serves as an estimator for various kinds of GraphScope resources.
    - GAE memory usage estimator:
        It would do a rough estimation of the total memory usage of the GAE.
        The actual memory usage may vary vastly due to the complexity of the graph algorithms and the data distribution.

        Here's some assumption when estimating the memory usage:
            1. Assuming the graph is a simple graph, e.g. only has 1 label and at most 1 property for each label.
            2. Assuming the graph algorithm has a fixed amount of memory consumption, e.g. PageRank, SSSP, CC;
               It should not generate a huge amount of intermediate result, like K-Hop, Louvain.
            3. Assuming the vertex map type is global vertex map

        Users should take this estimation as a reference and a starting point for tuning,
        and adjust the memory allocation according to the actual situation.

    """
    The estimation is based on the following formulas:
    let #V = number of vertices, #E = number of edges,
    assuming load_factor of hashmap is 0.41, sizeof(inner_id) = sizeof(edge_id) = sizeof(vertex_id) = 8 bytes,
    where vertex_id is the primary key of the vertex, default to int64,
    it could be string though, in that case, the memory usage will grow.
    Graph:
        1. vertex
            - vertex map: #V * (sizeof(vertex_id) + sizeof(inner_id)) * (1 / load_factor)
            - vertex table: size of vertex files in uncompressed CSV format, unit is GB
        2. edge
            - CSR + CSC: 2 * #E * (sizeof(inner_id) + sizeof(edge_id))
            - offset array: #V * sizeof(size_t)
            - edge table: size of vertex files in uncompressed CSV format, unit is GB
        3. additional data structure when graph is partitioned, assuming 10% of vertices will be outer vertices
            - outer vertex ID to local ID map: 0.1 * #V * (sizeof(vertex_id) + sizeof(inner_id)) * (1 / load_factor)
            - local ID to outer vertex ID array:  0.1 * #V * sizeof(size_t)
