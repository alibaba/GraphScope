    PageRank computes a ranking of the nodes in the graph G based on

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A networkx directed graph.

    alpha : float, optional
      Damping parameter for PageRank, default=0.85.

    max_iter : integer, optional

    tol : float, optional
      Error tolerance used to check convergence in power method solver.

    -------
    pagerank : dataframe

    >>> G = nx.DiGraph(nx.path_graph(4))
    >>> pr = nx.pagerank(G, alpha=0.9)

    Notes
    -----
    The eigenvector calculation is done by the power iteration method
    and has no guarantee of convergence.  The iteration will stop after
    an error tolerance of ``len(G) * tol`` has been reached. If the
    number of iterations exceed `max_iter`, computation just complete and
    return the current result.

    The PageRank algorithm was designed for directed graphs but this
    algorithm does not check if the input graph is directed.

    Katz centrality computes the centrality for a node based on the centrality

    .. math::

        x_i = \alpha \sum_{j} A_{ij} x_j + \beta,

    Katz centrality computes the relative influence of a node within a

    degree nodes) and also all other nodes in the network that connect
    to the node under consideration through these immediate neighbors.

    Extra weight can be provided to immediate neighbors through the

    should be strictly less than the inverse largest eigenvalue of the

    correctly. More information is provided in [1]_.

    Parameters

      A networkx graph.

    alpha : float
      Attenuation factor

    beta : scalar or dictionary, optional (default=1.0)

    Closeness centrality [1]_ of a node `u` is the reciprocal of the
    average shortest path distance to `u` over all `n-1` reachable nodes.

    .. math::

        C(u) = \frac{n - 1}{\sum_{v=1}^{n-1} d(v, u)},

    where `d(v, u)` is the shortest-path distance between `v` and `u`,
    and `n` is the number of nodes that can reach `u`. Notice that the
    closeness distance function computes the incoming distance to `u`
    for directed graphs. To use outward distance, act on `G.reverse()`.

    Notice that higher values of closeness indicate higher centrality.

    Wasserman and Faust propose an improved formula for graphs with
    more than one connected component. The result is "a ratio of the
    fraction of actors in the group who are reachable, to the average
    distance" from the reachable actors [2]_. You might think this
    scale factor is inverted but it is not. As is, nodes from small
    components receive a smaller closeness value. Letting `N` denote
    the number of nodes in the graph,

    .. math::

        C_{WF}(u) = \frac{n-1}{N-1} \frac{n - 1}{\sum_{v=1}^{n-1} d(v, u)},

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A networkx graph

    weight : edge attribute key, optional (default=None)
      Use the specified edge attribute as the edge distance in shortest
      path calculations, if None, every edge is assumed to be one.

    wf_improved : bool, optional (default=True)
      If True, scale by the fraction of nodes reachable. This gives the
      Wasserman and Faust improved formula. For single component graphs

def clustering(G):
    r"""Compute the clustering coefficient for nodes.

    For unweighted graphs, the clustering of a node :math:`u`
    is the fraction of possible triangles through that node that exist,

    .. math::

      c_u = \frac{2 T(u)}{deg(u)(deg(u)-1)},

    where :math:`T(u)` is the number of triangles through node :math:`u` and
    :math:`deg(u)` is the degree of :math:`u`.

    For weighted graphs, there are several ways to define clustering [1]_.
    the one used here is defined
    as the geometric average of the subgraph edge weights [2]_,

    .. math::

       c_u = \frac{1}{deg(u)(deg(u)-1))}
             \sum_{vw} (\hat{w}_{uv} \hat{w}_{uw} \hat{w}_{vw})^{1/3}.

    The edge weights :math:`\hat{w}_{uv}` are normalized by the maximum weight
    in the network :math:`\hat{w}_{uv} = w_{uv}/\max(w)`.

    The value of :math:`c_u` is assigned to 0 if :math:`deg(u) < 2`.

    For directed graphs, the clustering is similarly defined as the fraction
    of all possible directed triangles or geometric average of the subgraph
    edge weights for unweighted and weighted directed graph respectively [3]_.

    .. math::

       c_u = \frac{1}{deg^{tot}(u)(deg^{tot}(u)-1) - 2deg^{\leftrightarrow}(u)}
             T(u),

    where :math:`T(u)` is the number of directed triangles through node
    :math:`u`, :math:`deg^{tot}(u)` is the sum of in degree and out degree of
    :math:`u` and :math:`deg^{\leftrightarrow}(u)` is the reciprocal degree of
    :math:`u`.

    A *simple path* in a graph is a nonempty sequence of nodes in which

    Returns

    bool

    Notes
    -----
    An empty list of nodes is not a path but a list of one node is a
    path. Here's an explanation why.

    This function operates on *node paths*. One could also consider
    *edge paths*. There is a bijection between node paths and edge
    paths.

    The *length of a path* is the number of edges in the path, so a list
    of nodes of length *n* corresponds to a path of length *n* - 1.
    Thus the smallest edge path would be a list of zero edges, the empty
    path. This corresponds to a list of one node.

    To convert between a node path and an edge path, you can use code
    like the following::

        >>> from networkx.utils import pairwise
        >>> nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3]
        >>> edges = list(pairwise(nodes))

    fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through $v$

    .. math::

       c_B(v) =\sum_{s,t \in V} \frac{\sigma(s, t|v)}{\sigma(s, t)}

    where $V$ is the set of nodes, $\sigma(s, t)$ is the number of
    shortest $(s, t)$-paths,  and $\sigma(s, t|v)$ is the number of
    those paths  passing through some  node $v$ other than $s, t$.
    If $s = t$, $\sigma(s, t) = 1$, and if $v \in {s, t}$,
    $\sigma(s, t|v) = 0$ [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.

    k : int, optional (default=None)
      If k is not None use k node samples to estimate betweenness.
      The value of k <= n where n is the number of nodes in the graph.
      Higher values give better approximation.

    normalized : bool, optional
      If True the betweenness values are normalized by `2/((n-1)(n-2))`
      for graphs, and `1/((n-1)(n-2))` for directed graphs where `n`
      is the number of nodes in G.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
      If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
      Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.
      Weights are used to calculate weighted shortest paths, so they are
      interpreted as distances.

    endpoints : bool, optional
      If True include the endpoints in the shortest path counts.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
        Note that this is only used if k is not None.

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with betweenness centrality as the value.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm is from Ulrik Brandes [1]_.
    See [4]_ for the original first published version and [2]_ for details on
    algorithms for variations and related metrics.

    For approximate betweenness calculations set k=#samples to use
    k nodes ("pivots") to estimate the betweenness values. For an estimate
    of the number of pivots needed see [3]_.

    For weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero.
    Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length
    paths between pairs of nodes.

    The total number of paths between source and target is counted
    differently for directed and undirected graphs. Directed paths
    are easy to count. Undirected paths are tricky: should a path
    from "u" to "v" count as 1 undirected path or as 2 directed paths?

    For betweenness_centrality we report the number of undirected
    paths when G is undirected.

    For betweenness_centrality_subset the reporting is different.
    If the source and target subsets are the same, then we want
    to count undirected paths. But if the source and target subsets
    differ -- for example, if sources is {0} and targets is {1},
    then we are only counting the paths in one direction. They are
    undirected paths but we are counting them in a directed way.
    To count them as undirected paths, each should count as half a path.
