    ----------
    G : graph
      A networkx directed graph.

    alpha : float, optional
      Damping parameter for PageRank, default=0.85.

    max_iter : integer, optional

    The eigenvector calculation is done by the power iteration method
    and has no guarantee of convergence.  The iteration will stop after
    an error tolerance of ``len(G) * tol`` has been reached. If the
    number of iterations exceed `max_iter`, computation just complete and
    return the current result.

    The PageRank algorithm was designed for directed graphs but this
    algorithm does not check if the input graph is directed.

    Katz centrality computes the centrality for a node based on the centrality
    of its neighbors. It is a generalization of the eigenvector centrality. The
    Katz centrality for node $i$ is

    .. math::

        x_i = \alpha \sum_{j} A_{ij} x_j + \beta,

    The parameter $\beta$ controls the initial centrality and

    .. math::

    Katz centrality computes the relative influence of a node within a
    network by measuring the number of the immediate neighbors (first
    degree nodes) and also all other nodes in the network that connect
    to the node under consideration through these immediate neighbors.

    Extra weight can be provided to immediate neighbors through the
    parameter $\beta$.  Connections made with distant neighbors
    are, however, penalized by an attenuation factor $\alpha$ which
    should be strictly less than the inverse largest eigenvalue of the

    correctly. More information is provided in [1]_.

    Parameters

    Closeness centrality [1]_ of a node `u` is the reciprocal of the
    average shortest path distance to `u` over all `n-1` reachable nodes.

    .. math::

        C(u) = \frac{n - 1}{\sum_{v=1}^{n-1} d(v, u)},

    where `d(v, u)` is the shortest-path distance between `v` and `u`,
    and `n` is the number of nodes that can reach `u`. Notice that the
    closeness distance function computes the incoming distance to `u`
    for directed graphs. To use outward distance, act on `G.reverse()`.

    Notice that higher values of closeness indicate higher centrality.

    Wasserman and Faust propose an improved formula for graphs with
    more than one connected component. The result is "a ratio of the
    fraction of actors in the group who are reachable, to the average
    distance" from the reachable actors [2]_. You might think this
    scale factor is inverted but it is not. As is, nodes from small
    components receive a smaller closeness value. Letting `N` denote
    the number of nodes in the graph,

    .. math::

        C_{WF}(u) = \frac{n-1}{N-1} \frac{n - 1}{\sum_{v=1}^{n-1} d(v, u)},

    Parameters

    G : graph
      A networkx graph

    weight : edge attribute key, optional (default=None)
      Use the specified edge attribute as the edge distance in shortest
      path calculations, if None, every edge is assumed to be one.

    wf_improved : bool, optional (default=True)

    The edge weights :math:`\hat{w}_{uv}` are normalized by the maximum weight
    in the network :math:`\hat{w}_{uv} = w_{uv}/\max(w)`.

    The value of :math:`c_u` is assigned to 0 if :math:`deg(u) < 2`.

    For directed graphs, the clustering is similarly defined as the fraction
    of all possible directed triangles or geometric average of the subgraph
    edge weights for unweighted and weighted directed graph respectively [3]_.

    .. math::

       c_u = \frac{1}{deg^{tot}(u)(deg^{tot}(u)-1) - 2deg^{\leftrightarrow}(u)}
             T(u),

    where :math:`T(u)` is the number of directed triangles through node
    :math:`u`, :math:`deg^{tot}(u)` is the sum of in degree and out degree of
    :math:`u` and :math:`deg^{\leftrightarrow}(u)` is the reciprocal degree of
    :math:`u`.

    A *simple path* in a graph is a nonempty sequence of nodes in which
    no node appears more than once in the sequence, and each adjacent
    pair of nodes in the sequence is adjacent in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nodes : list
        A list of one or more nodes in the graph `G`.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether the given list of nodes represents a simple path in `G`.

    Notes
    -----
    An empty list of nodes is not a path but a list of one node is a
    path. Here's an explanation why.

    This function operates on *node paths*. One could also consider
    *edge paths*. There is a bijection between node paths and edge
    paths.

    The *length of a path* is the number of edges in the path, so a list
    of nodes of length *n* corresponds to a path of length *n* - 1.
    Thus the smallest edge path would be a list of zero edges, the empty
    path. This corresponds to a list of one node.

    To convert between a node path and an edge path, you can use code
    like the following::

        >>> from networkx.utils import pairwise
        >>> nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3]
        >>> edges = list(pairwise(nodes))
        >>> edges
        [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
        >>> nodes = [edges[0][0]] + [v for u, v in edges]
        >>> nodes
        [0, 1, 2, 3]

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> nx.is_simple_path(G, [2, 3, 0])
    True
    >>> nx.is_simple_path(G, [0, 2])
