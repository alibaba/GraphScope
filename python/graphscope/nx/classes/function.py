    The induced subgraph of a graph on a set of nodes N is the

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
    nbunch : node, container of nodes or None (for all nodes)

    Returns
    -------
    subgraph : SubGraph
        A independent deep copy of the subgraph in `G` induced by the nodes.

        An iterable of edges. Edges not present in `G` are ignored.

def set_node_attributes(G, values, name=None):
    """Sets node attributes from a given value or dictionary of values.

    .. Warning:: The call order of arguments `values` and `name`
        switched between v1.x & v2.x.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph

    values : scalar value, dict-like
        What the node attribute should be set to.  If `values` is
        not a dictionary, then it is treated as a single attribute value
        that is then applied to every node in `G`.  This means that if
        you provide a mutable object, like a list, updates to that object
        will be reflected in the node attribute for every node.
        The attribute name will be `name`.

        If `values` is a dict or a dict of dict, it should be keyed
        by node to either an attribute value or a dict of attribute key/value
        pairs used to update the node's attributes.

    name : string (optional, default=None)
        Name of the node attribute to set if values is a scalar.

    Examples
    --------
    After computing some property of the nodes of a graph, you may want
    to assign a node attribute to store the value of that property for
    each node::

        >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
        >>> bb = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)
        >>> isinstance(bb, dict)
        True
        >>> nx.set_node_attributes(G, bb, "betweenness")
        >>> G.nodes[1]["betweenness"]
        1.0

    If you provide a list as the second argument, updates to the list
    will be reflected in the node attribute for each node::

        >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
        >>> labels = []
        >>> nx.set_node_attributes(G, labels, "labels")
        >>> labels.append("foo")
        >>> G.nodes[0]["labels"]
        ['foo']
        >>> G.nodes[1]["labels"]
        ['foo']
        >>> G.nodes[2]["labels"]
        ['foo']

    If you provide a dictionary of dictionaries as the second argument,
    the outer dictionary is assumed to be keyed by node to an inner
    dictionary of node attributes for that node::

        >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
        >>> attrs = {0: {"attr1": 20, "attr2": "nothing"}, 1: {"attr2": 3}}
        >>> nx.set_node_attributes(G, attrs)
        >>> G.nodes[0]["attr1"]
        20
        >>> G.nodes[0]["attr2"]
        'nothing'
        >>> G.nodes[1]["attr2"]
        3
        >>> G.nodes[2]
        {}

    """
    # Set node attributes based on type of `values`
    if name is not None:  # `values` must not be a dict of dict
        try:  # `values` is a dict
