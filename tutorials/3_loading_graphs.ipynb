    "of [fsspec](https://github.com/intake/filesystem_spec) to resolve specific scheme and formats.\n",
    "Any additional configurations can be passed in kwargs of ``Loader``, which will be parsed \n",
    "directly by the specific class. e.g., ``host`` and ``port`` to ``hdfs``, or ``access-id``, ``secret-access-key`` to ``oss`` or ``s3``.\n",

    "is used to resolve specific protocol scheme, and ``AbstractBufferFile`` to read and write.\n",
    "The only methods the user needs to override is ``_upload_chunk``,\n",
    "``_initiate_upload`` and ``_fetch_range``. In the end, the user needs to use ``fsspec.register_implementation('protocol_name', 'protocol_file_system')`` to register corresponding resolver."
