    "## Node Classification on Citation Network\n",
    "\n",
    "As a start, we present a end to end example, demonstrating how GraphScope process node classification task on citation network by combining analytics, interactive and graph neural networks computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use [ogbn-mag](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-mag) dataset. ogbn-mag is a heterogeneous network composed of a subset of the Microsoft Academic Graph. It contains 4 types of entities(i.e., papers, authors, institutions, and fields of study), as well as four types of directed relations connecting two entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the heterogeneous ogbn-mag data, the task is to predict the class of each paper. We apply both the attribute and structural information to classify papers. In the graph, each paper node contains a 128-dimensional word2vec vector representing its content, which is obtained by averaging the embeddings of words in its title and abstract. The embeddings of individual words are pre-trained. The structural information is computed on-the-fly.\n",

    "This tutorial has the following steps:\n",
    "- Querying graph data with Gremlin;\n",
    "- Running graph analytical algorithms;\n",
    "- Running graph-based machine learning tasks."
