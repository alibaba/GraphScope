    "## Node Classification on Citation Network\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demostrate how GraphScope process node classification task on citation network by combining analytics, interactive and graph neural networks computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use [ogbn-mag](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-mag) dataset. ogbn-mag is a heterogeneous network composed of a subset of the Microsoft Academic Graph. It contains 4 types of entities(i.e., papers, authors, institutions, and fields of study), as well as four types of directed relations connecting two entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the heterogeneous ogbn-mag data, the task is to predict the class of each paper. We apply both the attribute and structural information to classify papers. In the graph, each paper node contains a 128-dimensional word2vec vector representing its content, which is obtained by averaging the embeddings of words in its title and abstract. The embeddings of individual words are pre-trained. The structural information is computed on-the-fly.\n",

    "- Creating a session and loading graph\n",
    "- Query graph data.\n",
    "- Run graph algorithm.\n",
